# Virtual Classroom Manager

## Abstract
The Virtual Classroom Manager is a terminal-based application designed to simulate the backend of an educational technology platform. It models essential operations such as classroom creation, student enrollment, assignment scheduling, and submission tracking. The project applies Object-Oriented Programming principles along with design patterns such as Singleton, Command, Factory, and Observer to ensure modularity, maintainability, and extensibility. It provides structured logging and exception handling, making the system robust while reflecting real-world EdTech backend challenges.

## Objectives
- To design and implement a console-based system for managing virtual classrooms, students, and assignments.  
- To apply appropriate design patterns to ensure scalability and clean separation of responsibilities.  
- To enforce SOLID principles and coding standards for maintainable and extensible code.  
- To provide structured logging and error handling for reliable runtime behavior.  
- To demonstrate how relationships between entities (classroom, student, assignment) can be modeled effectively.  

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional terminal-based application that supports:
  - Adding, removing, and listing classrooms.  
  - Enrolling and listing students within classrooms.  
  - Scheduling assignments and notifying enrolled students.  
  - Submitting assignments and recording submission logs.  
- A modular codebase that can be extended with additional features such as grading, deadlines, or persistence.  
- Logging of all system operations to both console and file for debugging and auditing.  
- A demonstration of clean, pattern-driven backend design suitable for real-world EdTech applications.
